# Holiday Road Grand Canyon!
* The goal of this project was to build a web application that allows a user to create a travel plan that consists of a National Park, a bizzarary, and an eatery.
* When the user selects a state, we call on the National Parks Services API to populate a dropdown of parks, and when they select a park we use the Open Weather API to generate a 5 day weather forecast so the user can see what the weather is going to be like in the near-future at the park they choose. We also use some open APIs to populate the dropdowns for bizzararies and eateries and provide details for all three selections when prompted. Once a user has selected all three options, they can save their trip to a local database using JSON-Server, and view their saved trips in the aside bar.
